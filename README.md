# DockerMongo

This is an example of MongoDB + Flask (using docker-compose) in action.

It's a simple Flask app that allows you to store and view content.

## Getting Started

Make sure to check the [YAML file](docker-compose.yml) first.
Simply running compose up should get you started:

```
docker compose up
```

## Docker Compose commands

See [Docker Compose README](COMPOSE.md).

## MongoDB commands

See [MongoDB README](MONGODB.md).

**NOTE:** Mongo Shell (`mongo`) has been replaced with `mongosh` as of version 6.
For the purposes of this class, we're going to stick with v5.0.5.
